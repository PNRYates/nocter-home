<h1 id="hello-i-t-">hello, I.T. !</h1>
<p>If you are reading this it&#39;s most likely because you saw this website in a list somewhere. As <a href="https://peteryates.net">https://peteryates.net</a> was blocked on the school wifi due to automated processes I set up this domain in order to use some tools I like at school. This includes backing up files to and from my school computer.</p>
<p> you can audit my usage of this domain through this <a href="https://subdomainfinder.c99.nl/">subdomain scanner</a> which will show nothing but some admin + budgeting stuff (maybe some other things not listed here because i forgot to update this page) but no evil things, I promise.</p>
<p>If something I&#39;m doing on this domain is deemed bad, I kindly request you email me asking to disable that specific service, instead of blocking the domain entirely as my backups are very useful. </p>
<p>(BTW if you are from the IT team please unblock Archive Utility on the school laptops as it is very annoying having to use tar to unzip google drive folder downloads)</p>
